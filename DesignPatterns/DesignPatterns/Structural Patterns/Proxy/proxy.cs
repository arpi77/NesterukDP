//Design Pattern: Proxy
//The Proxy design pattern is used to control access to an object.
//There are several common variations of this pattern, including
//the virtual proxy, which is often implemented for performance reasons,
//and the remote proxy, which is used to allow a remote object to be
//accessed by a local client without the need for the client to know
//anything about how to communicate over the network.
//The proxy pattern is also commonly used by OR/M tools to implement
//lazy loading of object state from persistence.
